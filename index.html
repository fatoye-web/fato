    <h3>Why I joined the Altschool School of Engineering Program</h3>
    <p>
      I joined the AltSchool School of Engineering program to learn and acquire
      knowledge of Cloud computing/engineering, and gain hands-on experience in
      cloud technologies to solve business problems and provide digital

      community-driven, and structured learning approach aligns with my goal of
      acquiring industry-relevant skills, collaborating with like-minded
